		<h1>The Top 03 Most Beautiful Websites</h1>
		<h2>THERE’S A LOT MORE TO MARKETING THAN PICTURES AND WORDS</h2>
		<h3>01.Mikiya Kobayashi</h3>
		<p>Product designer Mikiya Kobayashi creates stunning photographs of his product work and his website is fueled by them. The cleverness of the site’s design, though, is in how subtly it allows the visitor to simply take in the work while maintaining some interactive features such as simple animations and the ability to scroll to see different perspectives on the same product, all with smooth transitions throughout the site.</p>

		<p>We believe that it’s imperative today to be able to activate the entire marketing ecosystem. To connect the dots as appropriate (and there are a lot more dots than there used to be). To do so, we offer a full range of connected capabilities.</p>
		<h3>02.Ogilvy One Worldwide</h3>
		<p>While providing thorough information about their business set, this design is simple, but remains attractive, strategically using appealing, colorful images blurred to set off the company’s marketing verbiage. The scrolling design is soothing, allowing visuals to fade in and out, and presenting visitors with an integrated, responsive experience. The footer uses shapes and graphics to tie the entire design together.</p>

		<h3>03.Kenshoo</h3>
		<p>Kenshoo’s website proves that they understand design trends; they’ve mastered the microinteraction and made navigation wonderfully simple. The site is also truly beautiful, making it stand alone visually as it delivers information simply and effectively. The design also proves that the business has value to add, as a marketing firm, by using its information delivery system to maintain web traffic on the site and display things in a eye-catching manner.</p>
